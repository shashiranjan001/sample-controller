## extended sample-controller

The extended sample-controller implements an operator for a VM resource kind.

### Get started

#### 1. Run the mock cloud API server.

```sh
docker run -d --name cloud-server --restart unless-stopped --net host shprakas/cloud-server:latest
```

When the docker container starts, it will accept requests on port 9001.
Note down the IP of the host machine where we are running the container.
Let's assume the private cloud API endpoint is listening to requests at http://10.10.10.10:9001

#### 2. Install the helm package for the sample-controller

```sh
helm upgrade --install sample-controller helm/ --create-namespace --set cloudApiUrl="http://10.10.10.10:9001"
```
